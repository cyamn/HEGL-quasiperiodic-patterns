      "text": "A tiling is a set of geometric shapes, called tiles, that are arranged in such a way to fill a plane without gaps or overlaps. A tiling can be periodic or non- periodic. Periodic tilings are constructed with a repeating pattern - the tiling has translational symmetry. The different types of tiles that make up a tiling are called the prototiles of that tiling. A tiling may be constructed using one or many prototiles."
